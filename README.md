# üõ°Ô∏è SIEM Implementation and Its Use Cases

## üìå Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of a **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)** system using **Wazuh** in a lab environment simulating a small business setup.  
The goal was to configure log collection, correlation rules, and real-time alerts for detecting common cyber threats, while ensuring a **cost-effective and scalable open-source solution**.

---

## üöÄ Features
- Centralized **Wazuh SIEM framework** with Manager, Agents, Indexer, and Dashboard.  
- **Custom rules & alerts** for:  
  - Brute-force attacks  
  - Unauthorized access attempts  
  - File Integrity Monitoring (FIM)  
  - USB-based Endpoint Detection & Response (EDR)  
- **Threat response workflows** with automated actions like IP blocking and notifications.  
- Secure communication between components using **AES/TLS encryption**.  
- Compliance-ready for standards such as **ISO 27001, HIPAA, GDPR**.

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

```
+---------------------+         +-------------------+
|  Windows/Linux      |  Logs   |                   |
|  Endpoints (Agents) +-------->+   Wazuh Manager   |
|  (Wazuh Agents)     |         |                   |
+---------------------+         +-------------------+
                                         |
                                         v
                               +-------------------+
                               |   Wazuh Indexer   |
                               | (OpenSearch)      |
                               +-------------------+
                                         |
                                         v
                               +-------------------+
                               | Wazuh Dashboard   |
                               |  (Web UI)         |
                               +-------------------+
```

This architecture ensures logs are collected at endpoints, analyzed by the Wazuh Manager, indexed for search, and visualized in real time through the Dashboard.
